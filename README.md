# matplotlib-challenge
The analysis of this challenge focused on examining the impact of various drug treatments on mice tumor volume. Capomulin and Ramicane were found to have the highest number of mice tested, while Propriva had the lowest. The pie chart displayed an almost equal distribution of male and female mice. Box plots illustrated that Capomulin and Ramicane led to reduced tumor volumes compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin, with Infubinol possibly having an outlier. A line plot depicted a significant decrease in tumor volume over time for a mouse treated with Capomulin. The scatter plot and linear regression analysis emphasized a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, indicating that heavier mice tend to have larger tumors, with an R-squared value of 0.709 suggesting a good fit for the regression model. 
Additionally, the findings suggest that Capomulin and Ramicane are more effective in reducing tumor volume compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin, as evidenced by lower tumor volumes and significant tumor size reduction over time in mice treated with Capomulin. The nearly equal gender distribution of mice ensures unbiased results. The positive correlation between weight and tumor volume indicates that heavier mice are more prone to larger tumors, which should be considered in drug efficacy and dosage contexts. Recommendations include further analysis of the potential outlier in the Infubinol group, performing similar analyses for other drug regimens, collecting more data points to strengthen the analysis, and validating these statistical findings with biological insights and experimental conditions.
